### Predictive Maintenance System for Industrial Machines

**Project Overview:**
Developed and deployed a predictive maintenance system using the AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset. The project involved creating an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict machine failures, ensuring timely maintenance and reducing downtime.

**Key Responsibilities:**

**Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:**
- Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset and identify key features.
- Handled missing values and performed data cleaning to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- Converted categorical variables to numerical values using one-hot encoding.
- Scaled continuous features using StandardScaler to normalize the data.
- Addressed class imbalance using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to improve model performance.

**Model Training and Evaluation:**
- Split the dataset into training and test sets to evaluate model performance.
- Trained a Random Forest Classifier to predict machine failures, leveraging its robustness and interpretability.
- Evaluated the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable predictions.

**Model Deployment:**
- Implemented a Streamlit web application to serve the trained model as a web service.
- Designed a user-friendly interface for inputting machine data and receiving predictions.
- Deployed the Streamlit application, enabling real-time predictions for machine maintenance.

**Tools and Technologies:**
